layout better

allow you to paste into template message

security/GDPR Qs

"send to mobile" function
    - use QR codes:
        - stringify data
        - convert to QR code
        - lib like this to scan: https://www.npmjs.com/package/html5-qrcode
        - potentially needs to be multiple QR codes but that should be fine?? - encode into the QR code whether or not you need to do multiple so both web and mobile can behave accordingly
    - tel: call links too

make it all more obvious and clear

script function

feedback function????

add signal -
    probably need "generate/copy msg button" and then share link separate, like: sgnl://signal.me/#p/+447903700751 
    maybe not? maybe no way to make it secure enough really
