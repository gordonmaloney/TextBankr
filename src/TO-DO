    - use QR codes:
        - stringify data
        - convert to QR code
        - lib like this to scan: https://www.npmjs.com/package/html5-qrcode
        - potentially needs to be multiple QR codes but that should be fine?? - encode into the QR code whether or not you need to do multiple so both web and mobile can behave accordingly
    - tel: call links too
